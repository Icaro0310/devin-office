# devin-office — Linux guide

This guide covers Linux setup only. See [README.md](README.md) for features, shared commands, limitations, and the safety model.

Linux uses the extended runtime: local execution plus optional Devin VM/QwenPaw delegation when this artifact supports it.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Git for a source checkout.
- Devin Desktop or CLI on the machine whose sessions you want to view.

## Install

From a repository checkout, run the standalone read-only dashboard:

```bash
python3 daemon.py --port 8788
```

Open `http://localhost:8788`; the process stops with Ctrl+C.

## Devin paths

Session data normally lives under `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/devin/cli/`; UI state and ACP stores under `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/Devin/User/`.
Use the tool's documented `--data-dir` or `--config-dir` flags for non-default locations.

## Environment notes

- Delegated runtime is optional; this guide installs local tooling only.
- Linux can use additional compute or Linux-compatible delegated tooling when available.
- macOS is planned but not claimed as tested.

## Linux specifics

- **Installer choice:** `uv tool install` is the recommended path (isolated environment, managed Python). `pipx install` works identically for PyPI packages; `pip install --user` is the last-resort fallback — no isolation, watch dependency conflicts.
- **PATH:** executables land in `~/.local/bin`. If a command is not found, add `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` to `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` and open a new shell.
- **Distros:** tested on Ubuntu; Debian, Fedora and Arch follow the same steps — only `uv`/Python acquisition differs (distro package or the uv installer script).
- **Headless and minimal environments:** no display is needed — every CLI is text-only. In containers or WSL, install `uv` and Git and follow the same steps; `XDG_*` paths resolve normally.
- **Permissions:** tools read Devin data under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/devin` and write only their own config/state — no root or sudo is required.
- **Scheduling:** optional recurring work belongs to `systemd --user` timers or cron; installation never creates jobs.

## Recurring runs (optional)

_Long-running daemon — prefer `systemd --user` service on Linux or a logon trigger (`/sc onlogon`) on Windows, not an interval._

```cron
@reboot python daemon.py --port 8788
```

Equivalent `systemd --user` timer works too; enable lingering if it must run without a login session.


## Troubleshooting

- Start the daemon from the repository directory with the OS-specific Python launcher shown above.
